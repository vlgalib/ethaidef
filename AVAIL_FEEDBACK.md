## Overall Experience
Rating: 8/10

## What Worked Well
- SDK was straightforward to install via npm
- TypeScript support made integration smooth
- Bridge transaction preparation API was intuitive
- Testnet configuration worked without issues
- Good separation of concerns between source and destination chains

## Challenges Faced
- Initial setup required understanding of multiple chain configurations
- Error messages could be more descriptive for common misconfigurations
- Limited examples for complex cross-chain scenarios in documentation
- Some type definitions could be more comprehensive

## Suggestions for Improvement
1. Add more comprehensive cross-chain bridge examples
2. Better TypeScript type definitions for all response objects
3. Improved error handling utilities with user-friendly messages
4. More testnet faucet integration or guidance
5. Performance optimization guides for high-volume applications

## Technical Implementation
- Used Avail Nexus SDK for cross-chain bridging between Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Base
- Integrated with AI yield analysis to determine optimal target chains
- Implemented automated bridging based on yield differentials

## Would Recommend: Yes
The Avail Nexus SDK enabled our core cross-chain functionality with minimal custom code, making it an excellent choice for DeFi applications requiring seamless multi-chain operations.
